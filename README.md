### About the Project
This project simulates a Full Associative Cache Mapping function that uses Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement algorithm technique. The project is able to support the following:
- Simpleton (where the user inputs all the necessary data including the values for the main memory sequence)
- Random (where the values for the main memory sequence are generated by the computer)
- Sequential, that runs for _n_ loops and provided the ending main memory value _x_ for the iteration (where _n_ is the number of iterations for the mapping and memory is to be iterated from 0 to _x_)

## How to Use the Application
### A. Main Menu

Upon loading the self-executable jar file, the user will encounter the main menu prompt where they can choose which type of cache mapping they can perform, with the choices being limited to Random, Simpleton, and Sequential. Upon being clicked, the user will be redirected to the corresponding page for the chosen cache mapping.

### B. Random Menu

When Random input mapping is clicked, the user will be redirected to the input page where they are required to fill in the necessary fields before being allowed to simulate cache mapping.

The user is expected to fill in the following fields:
1. **Block Size**: Size of the block in words.
2. **Cache Memory Size**: Size of the cache memory (user can choose between block or word).
3. **Main Memory Size**: Size of the main memory (user can choose between block or word).
4. **Cache Access Time**: Time used for accessing the cache (represented in nanoseconds).
5. **Memory Access Time**: Time used for accessing the memory (represented in nanoseconds).

In the **Main Memory Sequence Value** field, the numbers are randomly generated by the computer upon the page being loaded. The user can opt to change the random number sequence by clicking _Generate Values_ button found on the upper right corner of the input fields.
